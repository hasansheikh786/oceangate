                <p>The USS Arizona (BB-39) was a Pennsylvania-class battleship of the United States Navy, commissioned
                    in 1916. Here's a detailed description: <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Construction and Dimensions:</span> The USS Arizona was constructed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and
                    it was commissioned on October 17, 1916. It had a length of 608 feet (185 meters) and a beam (width)
                    of 97 feet 1 inch (29.6 meters). Its full load displacement was approximately 31,400 long tons. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Armament:</span> The primary armament of the USS Arizona consisted of twelve 14-inch (356 mm) guns
                    mounted in four triple turrets, two forward and two aft. It also had an array of secondary
                    armaments, including twenty-two 5-inch (127 mm) guns, four 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft guns, and
                    various smaller caliber guns for anti-aircraft defense. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Armor Protection:</span> The ship had armor plating to protect vital areas. This included a main
                    belt armor that was up to 13.5 inches (343 mm) thick, designed to protect against enemy gunfire.
                    Additionally, its armored deck was up to 3 inches (76 mm) thick...</p> <br><br>
                    <div class="content">

                   <p><span class="span2">Propulsion:</span> The USS Arizona was powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines, which were fed
                    by twelve Babcock & Wilcox boilers. This propulsion system generated a total of 29,000 shaft
                    horsepower, enabling the ship to achieve a top speed of 21 knots (39 km/h). <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Service History:</span> The USS Arizona served primarily in the Pacific Fleet during its career. It
                    participated in training exercises, fleet maneuvers, and diplomatic missions in the interwar period.
                    However, it is most famously remembered for its role in World War II. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Attack on Pearl Harbor:</span> On December 7, 1941, the USS Arizona was moored at Pearl Harbor,
                    Hawaii, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During the attack,
                    the ship was hit by several bombs, one of which penetrated the forward magazine, causing a massive
                    explosion. The ship sank rapidly, with the loss of 1,177 crewmen, accounting for almost half of the
                    total casualties suffered by the United States during the attack. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Memorial:</span>The wreck of the USS Arizona still rests at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, and it
                    serves as a memorial to those who lost their lives during the attack. The USS Arizona Memorial,
                    built over the sunken hull, is one of the most visited sites in Hawaii and a poignant reminder of
                    the events of December 7, 1941. <br><br>

                    The USS Arizona remains a symbol of American resilience and sacrifice, and its sinking continues to
                    be a significant event in U.S. naval history.</p>
