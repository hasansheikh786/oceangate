                <p>The RMS Titanic was a British luxury passenger liner that tragically sank on its maiden voyage from
                    Southampton to New York City in April 1912 after striking an iceberg. Here's a detailed description: <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Construction and Dimensions:</span>The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in
                    Belfast, Ireland. It was one of three Olympic-class ocean liners built by the company. The Titanic
                    was approximately 882 feet 9 inches (269 meters) long, with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches
                    (28 meters) and a height from the waterline to the top of the funnels of 175 feet (53 meters). It
                    was one of the largest and most luxurious ships of its time. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Luxury Amenities:</span>The Titanic was renowned for its opulent interiors and luxurious amenities,
                    designed to cater to the wealthiest passengers. It featured amenities such as a grand staircase,
                    lavish dining rooms, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, a Turkish bath, libraries, and elegant lounges.
                    First-class accommodations were especially lavish, featuring spacious cabins and private promenades. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Passenger Accommodations:</span>The Titanic had accommodations for approximately 2,224 passengers
                    and crew. It offered accommodations across three classes: First, Second, and Third (Steerage).
                    First-class passengers enjoyed the most luxurious amenities and spacious cabins, while Third-class
                    passengers had more modest accommodations...</p> <br><br>
                    <div class="content">

                    <p><span class="span2">Engineering:</span>The Titanic was powered by a combination of reciprocating engines and steam
                    turbines, driving three propellers. It was equipped with 29 boilers that powered the ship's engines,
                    generating enough power to propel the massive vessel through the water. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Fateful Voyage:</span>The Titanic departed from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, making
                    stops in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, before setting off across the North
                    Atlantic towards New York City. On the night of April 14, 1912, the ship struck an iceberg and began
                    to sink. Despite efforts to evacuate passengers and launch lifeboats, the ship ultimately foundered
                    and sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912. <br><br>

                    <span class="span2">Casualties:</span>The sinking of the Titanic resulted in the deaths of over 1,500 people, making it
                    one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The tragedy sparked widespread public
                    outcry and led to significant reforms in maritime safety regulations, including the requirement for
                    ships to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew. <br><br>

                    The sinking of the Titanic remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, capturing
                    the imagination of people worldwide and inspiring numerous books, films, and documentaries.</p>
