                <h2>Founding and acquisition of Antipodes</h2>
                <small>2009–2013: </small>
                <p>OceanGate was founded by Guillermo Söhnlein and Stockton Rush in Seattle in 2009.[14][15][16][17]
                    According to Söhnlein, the company was founded with the intention of creating a small fleet of
                    5-person commercial submersibles that could be leased by any organization or group of individuals.
                    In 2023 he told Sky News, "The whole intent was to create these worked subs. And in that way, as our
                    tagline was in the early days, 'Open the oceans for all of humanity.'"[18]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The company's first submersible was Antipodes, a used 5-person vessel with a steel hull. Between
                    2010 and 2013 the company carried out an estimated 130 dives with Antipodes. The company's business
                    model involved renting its submersible out for hire to researchers and transporting tourists, who
                    the company referred to as "citizen scientists" for underwater excursions. Söhnlein estimated in
                    2012 that passengers typically paid between $7,500 and $40,000 per person per excursion depending on
                    the trip.[19]...

                    <br>
                    <p>first tourist excursion was conducted in 2010 when the company began transporting its first
                        paying customers. The company transported tourist groups to Catalina Island off the coast of
                        California. To improve the tourist experience, the company began bringing expert guides aboard
                        the dives. According to Rush, "People would ask me about a fish, and I wouldn't know anything
                        about it." The company first brought marine biologists on as expert guides and according to Rush
                        "The difference was night and day. Their excitement permeated the sub."[6]
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In 2010 OceanGate worked with the University of Washington for the first time. The university
                        utilized Antipodes to conduct trials of novel sonar equipment and robotic arms.[20]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2011 Antipodes was used to survey and map the wreckage of the SS Governor, a ship that had
                        sunk in Puget Sound in 1921.[21]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2012 and 2013 OceanGate operated for a year in Miami, Florida. Collaborating with Miami-Dade
                        Artificial Reefs Program, researchers aboard Antipodes investigated the spread of
                        lionfish.[22][19]

                <p>In 2013 the company pivoted to designing its own submersibles with unique designs that were more cost
                    effective. Söhnlein left the company that same year, saying that OceanGate had transitioned from its
                    initial phase to Rush's specialty of engineering. Söhnlein retained a minority stake.[23]...</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>OceanGate worked on the design of its first custom-built submersible Cyclops, later called
                        Cyclops 1, in collaboration with the University of Washington and Boeing.[24][25] The hull was
                        planned to be a carbon fiber hull, but OceanGate instead acquired a 12-year-old vessel Lula from
                        a company in Azores. It extracted the cylindrical steel hull of the Lula and used it to create
                        Cyclops 1.[20][26] Cyclops was unveiled in 2015.[27] The same year, the company moved its
                        headquarters to the Port of Everett's Waterfront Center office space in Everett,
                        Washington.[28][29]</p>

                <p>OceanGate ordered the first titanium components for Cyclops 2 in December 2016,[30] and let a
                    contract to Spencer Composites in January 2017 to design and build the cylindrical carbon fiber
                    hull.[31] In March 2018, Cyclops 2 was renamed to Titan;[32] Rush described it as "an amazing
                    engineering feat" during its launch in 2018.[33] Testing of Titan to its maximum intended depth of
                    4,000 m (13,000 ft) occurred in 2018 and 2019...</p>

                    <p> 2019, OceanGate said they were planning to develop the successor Cyclops 3 and Cyclops 4
                        submersibles with a targeted maximum depth of 6,000 m (20,000 ft),[34] and in early 2020
                        announced that the development and manufacturing of the hulls would be performed at NASA's
                        Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.[35] The submersibles would be funded
                        through a new round of investments by "100% insiders" totaling $18.1 million, as announced in
                        January 2020.[36] NASA's participation was under a Space Act Agreement intended to further
                        "deep-space exploration goals" and "improve materials and manufacturing for American industry"
                        according to John Vickers.[37] In spring 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, OceanGate applied
                        for, and received, a PPP loan for approx. $450,000, based on 22 jobs.[38]

                        In 2021 and 2022, OceanGate conducted dives to the Titanic aboard its submersible Titan.

                <p>Titan imploded during an expedition to the Titanic in June 2023, killing all five occupants including
                    CEO Stockton Rush. After a four-day search and rescue operation by an international team led by the
                    United States Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, and Canadian Coast Guard,[39] a debris field was discovered
                    containing parts of Titan, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic.[40]...</p>

                        after the implosion, its subsidiary OceanGate Expeditions also suspended operations.[42] From
                        July 2023, OceanGate's websites defaulted to a message advising: "OceanGate has suspended all
                        exploration and commercial operations."[43]</p>
